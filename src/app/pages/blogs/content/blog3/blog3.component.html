  If you’re reading this blog, I assume you’re not satisfied with your company’s
  engagement with your target audience or you want to increase it positively or
  both. Searching on Google, there are so many ways you can find to help it. I’m
  going to narrow it all down for you after filtering out the mediocre methods,
  so you can get the best in one read.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The first and foremost action you need to take, which makes you pay too high
  of a cost if ignored, is understanding your target segment in and out. You
  need to be sure about:
</p>
<ol class="my-2">
  <li>1. Their wants</li>
  <li>2. What your competitors are giving</li>
  <li>3. What they aren’t giving</li>
  <li>
    4. Presenting your product/service in the way that appeals the most to the
    wants which are left unfulfilled
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Knowing your target segment’s wants asks for surveys and detailed market
  research. Once you’re sure of the segment’s personality, skin and bones, you
  can focus on the competitors present, their propaganda and advertisement
  policies. Knowing your competitors as much as your (potential) customers will
  help you to differentiate yourself and highlight your value in the market.
  Differentiation can be done by adding value to your product/service, or/and
  adding value to your presentation, which brings us to the fourth point.
</p>
<p>
  It all comes down to the presentation in the end, ain’t it? As said in the
  title, what a company needs to get successful is to hook the target segment,
  hold their attention and brand recall rate and control it to its benefit. To
  hook a mind requires individuality, using the benefit of choice for the best
  and developing a message different from the rest. You need to step out from
  the crowd, be proud of it and make people talk about your decision.

<p>
  Starting with coming up with a catchy slogan, there are a few more influential
  ways to grow your individuality that promise to break the status quo:
</p>
<p>
  We can begin with three of the most prominent of them all: 2D, 2.5D & 3D
  animation. 2D and 3D animation are the most prevalent kinds of animation.
  However, a new type of animation, 2.5D animation, is gaining popularity.
</p>
<p>
  2D is the simplest form of animation but potent in many ways. It gives flat
  background and flat characters but the same helps in causing less strain to
  the viewer’s eyes. Thus, it can be used to tell a story or show statistics or
  any other kind of information.
</p>
<p>
  Like the name suggests, 2.5D is somewhere between 2D and 3D. The objects are
  created in 3D within a 2D space. Thus, a flat background with the focus of the
  video in 3D gives a peculiar experience to the eyes. Here’s an example of 2.5D
  animation:
</p>
<div class="p-16">
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="300px"

  ></iframe>
</div>
<p>
  I guess all of us are familiar with 3D animation and the exposure it provides.
  3D videos produce a lot of depth to the screen making it visually immersive,
  enjoyable and memorable. The sophistication and details provided in 3D
  animation can be used for product/service presentation or explanation.
</p>
<p>
  Other than these, Motion Graphics owns an immense value in the market of
  digital advertising about which we’ve already read in the last 2 blogs. Do
  check them out if you haven’t!
