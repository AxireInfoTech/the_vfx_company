  Is it fair to say that the video was successful in making you get the
  importance of standing out in a day full of ads?
</p>
<p>
  Animation or rather, Motion Graphics has the capability of portraying the

  or post(er)s. The viewers are provided with a simplified presentation with no
  space left for misunderstanding or confusion.

  Motion graphics animations, which combine designs, visuals, and audio, have a
  20% better conversion rate than other content marketing formats.

  an explainer video, a social media video, or a presentation, has been found to
  improve front page Google results by more than 50 times, and has showed a
  higher double click rate when utilized in email campaigns.
</p>
<h1>OTHER BENEFITS</h1>
<p>
  A good use of visuals and audio certainly guarantees a strong brand recall as
  it kind of imprints on the brain and appeals to the emotions. Yes, it also
  holds emotional value by discarding boring statistics and bringing in
  imagination and creativity on the table. With this, the chances of receiving a
  positive response increases.
