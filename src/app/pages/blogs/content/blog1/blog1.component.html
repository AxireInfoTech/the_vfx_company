  Digital Marketing is becoming the new definition of marketing leaving lesser
  and lesser space for traditional marketing with the passing of time, mainly
  because of its characteristic of being innovative. It is enabling us, as
  firms, to rethink our marketing methods in order to better connect with the
  target consumers and remain relevant in their eyes. It’s about shifting our
  focus from deciding on the medium to deciding on the content. The content that
  can hold their thumbs from scrolling over and instead can make them click (pun
  intended), the content gluey enough to not let their eyes move past. It’s the
  content that reigns.

<p>
  And this isn’t a secret I’m disclosing as a beginning for this article. Most
  of us have already entered this realm. As per the recent Forrester Research
  report, digital ad spending would make up 46% of all advertisement spending in
  2021. But what might be new to our eyes are the following facts:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc my-2 mx-4">
  <li>
    93% of marketers report an increase in ROI after indulging in video
    creation, according to Animoto’s Social Video Trends: Consumer and Marketer
    Insights 2022.
  </li>
  <li>
    The percentage of marketers sharing videos in 2021 increased from 2019 by
    over 10% for both Instagram and Facebook.
  </li>
  <li>
    39% of consumers watched more video ads on social media than on TV in 2019.
    This year, that number rose to 58%.
  </li>
  <li>
    No matter how cringy a video ad can get, it always will have far more effect
    than this article.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Shocking, isn’t it? So, maybe video creation is the new cheat code of today’s
  market.
</p>
<p>
  However, videos are all around, and in marketing, you have to make yourself
  heard over the din.
</p>
<p>
  TA TA TA DA TA DA TA DA ! Motion Branding enters the scene, proud as digital
  marketing once entered the scene years ago.
</p>
<p>Now, wait. How is Motion Branding actually different from normal videos?</p>
<p>

    tools that motion graphics are better equipped than video to provide. These
    allow you to take the details of your brand and elevate them."</strong

  I think this pretty much gives away the concept. Motion graphics are excellent
  for displaying your brand while discussing a complicated product or service.
</p>
<p>
  Consider this. You’re trying to advertise your brand-new EV charging station
  provision facility coming with the franchise of your garages. You’re obviously
  going to record videos of the same to captivate the target groups on online
  platforms after making its posters. But, the bitter truth is that it’s going
  to bring a few yawns to life after the first few seconds of involvement.
</p>
<p>
  Now, check out this motion graphics video we’ve created for a company desiring
  the same kind of digital advertisement.

  Motion graphics becomes Motion Branding when it reaches its potential to
  gather a great amount of leads. It’s attractive to the eyes, wayyyy more
  engaging and an easy plan to stand out of the crowd. It creates a long lasting
  impression on the viewer’s mind that further increases your brand’s recall
  value.
</p>
<p>
  Taking all of these in consideration, it gets very evident why Motion Branding
  is being a superhero in the world of Digital Marketing right now. A few years
  left for it to rule over the rest of the marketing techniques and everyone
  who’ll be left from adapting to this will regret.
</p>
<p><strong>I hope you won’t.</strong></p>
